iPod Menu Simulation with React

This project simulates the iPod menu interface using React.js. It replicates the iPod’s circular navigation and dynamic content display. Key features include:

Circular Menu Navigation: Main options like Settings, Games, Music, and Videos are arranged in a central, circular layout.

Submenu Support: The Music section includes a submenu for additional options (e.g., All Songs, Artists).

Interactive Navigation: Clicking on a menu option opens a new screen; the “Menu” button returns to the main menu.

Responsive UI: The app is mobile-first, adjusting to different screen sizes while maintaining the iPod’s classic interface look.

Minimalist Design: The UI reflects the clean, simple design of the original iPod, focusing on usability and aesthetics.

React.js
